            It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a
            hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic
            Empire.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the
            Empire’s ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station
            with enough power to destroy an entire planet

            Pursued by the Empire’s sinister agents, Princess Leia races home
            aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her
            people and restore freedom to the galaxy . . . .
